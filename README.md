# DrumKit
DrumKit is a web-application that allows the user to make different drum sounds through the buttons they press on the screen or on their keyboard. This was a challenge application given to me by my instructor Angela Yu, on an online Web Dev course.

# What I used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# What I learned
I learned about several advanced javascript topics, such as high order functions and callback functions. I also learned a great deal of DOM manipulation techniques (text manipulation, style manipulation, attribute manipulation, etc). Learned how to use sound in web applications as well as the basics of animation.
